# General Information
This is a week long data science pedagogy workshop for educators of underrepresented, underserved college students in data science. The goals of the workshop are to: 
1. help educators, who are new to the field, build sound foundations in data science
2. expose data science educators to current "state-of-the-art" methodologies and tools in data science
3. facilitate a supportive environment for educators to develop data science pedagogical materials that are customized to the needs of their own students. 

### Who is organizing the workshop?

This workshop is organized by the Institute of Applied Computational Sciences at Harvard University. The members of the program committee are:
- Weiwei Pan (Harvard IACS)
- David Sondak (Harvard IACS)

### What will you do at the workshop?
The workshop consists of 7 days of data science/machine learning tutorial followed by team-based practical sessions focused on developing effective data science pedagogy. In this workshop:
1.  you will be introduced to fundamental as well as "state-of-the-art" stadata science/machine learning concepts and methods
2.  you will be able to get hands-on experience implementing data science methodology and machine learning models
3.  you will be able to connect and work with data science educators from different institutions across the US
4.  you will be able to develop data science pedagogical materials (syllabi, lesson plans, homework assignments, projects etc) customized to the needs of your students and your home institution 

Workshop participants will also receive free admission to Harvard IACS's annual ComputeFest (taking place right after the workshop). At ComputeFest, participants have opportunities to participate in additional data science workshops and seminars as well as make connections with many Boston area universities and tech industries. 

### Who should apply for the workshop?
We invite applications from educators who are currently teaching or plan to teach in data science or machine learning curriculum. Our core mission is to support educational equality in tech, specifically, we aim to support programs and initiatives for increasing diversity and eqality in tech education. As such, we ask all applicants to explicitly and concretely address ways in which they currently or plan to serve students who are underrepresented in tech. 

Programming experience as well as some previous training in probability, statistics and mathematics is helpful. But we welcome participants from all technical backgrounds!

### What is the application process like?
The application consists of:
1. an updated resume or CV
2. a statement of purpose addressing the following:
 - what is your background in data science? If you are just entering the field, what is your general technical background?
 - in what ways do you currently or plan to teach in the data science or machine learning curriculum at your home institution? If your institution currently does not offer any data science related courses, do you plan to create a data science course or incorporate data science components into existing courses?
 - how does your home institution currently address the the needs of students from underrepresented groups in tech? In what ways do you anticipate your participation in this workshop to help better serve these students?
 - in general, what do you hope to gain from participating in this workshop?

The application is ***free***.

### When and where is the workshop located?

The workshop will be held *remotely* via [Zoom](https://zoom.us), sometime during January. We hope to schedule it during the winter break period for most US colleges and universities.
