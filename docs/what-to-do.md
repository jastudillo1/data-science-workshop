The workshop consists of 5 days of data science/machine learning tutorial followed by team-based practical sessions focused on developing effective data science pedagogy. 

In this workshop:
1.  you will be introduced to fundamental as well as "state-of-the-art" stadata science/machine learning concepts and methods
2.  you will be able to get hands-on experience implementing data science methodology and machine learning models
3.  you will be able to connect and work with data science educators from different institutions across the US
4.  you will be able to develop data science pedagogical materials. You will create a syllabus and lesson plans for a data science course as well as homework assignments and projects ideas customized to the needs of your students and your home institution 

Workshop participants will also receive free admission to Harvard IACS's annual ComputeFest (taking place right after the workshop). At ComputeFest, participants have opportunities to participate in additional data science workshops and seminars as well as make connections with many Boston area universities and tech industries.
