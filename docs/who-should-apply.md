# Who should apply for the workshop?
We invite applications from educators who are currently teaching or plan to teach in data science or machine learning curriculum. Our core mission is to support educational equality in tech, specifically, we aim to support programs and initiatives for increasing diversity and eqality in tech education. As such, we ask all applicants to explicitly and concretely address ways in which they currently or plan to serve students who are underrepresented in tech. 

Programming experience as well as some previous training in probability, statistics and mathematics is helpful. But we welcome participants from all technical backgrounds!
